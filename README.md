## Introduction

We are going to be working with Twitch's api version 5, and using it to search for channels.  API stands for Application Programming Interface, and API's are used to allow programs to interface with the service an API is made for.  In twitch's case, we can use their API to search their database for users, channels, or other information.

## Getting started

The first thing we need to do is to get ourselves an API key.  You do this by signing in or registering an account with twitch, then going to the connections tab in account settings. ![Image](settings-connection.png)

At the bottom of the connections tab, you will find a button to register your application

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Sorakri/Sorakri.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
